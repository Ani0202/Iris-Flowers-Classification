# Iris-Flowers-Classification
The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals. This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower.
Here I have used Support Vector Machine Algorithm and K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithms to train the models on the train datasets.
The Accuracy of the models were:
  SVM: 97.77%
  KNN: 100% on test set and 95.23% on train set
